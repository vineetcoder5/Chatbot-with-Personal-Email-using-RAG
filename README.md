# Chatbot-with-Personal-Email-using-RAG
â€¢ This project demonstrates the implementation of a chatbot that uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to efficiently answer email-related queries. By leveraging a Pretrained Large Language Model (LLM) for natural language processing, the chatbot can retrieve relevant emails from a dataset and generate accurate, fluent responses based on user input.
Features

Natural Language Understanding: The chatbot is capable of handling complex queries, thanks to the integration of a powerful LLM. This allows for a seamless interaction experience, making the bot effective in understanding and processing user intent.

Email Retrieval: The chatbot uses RAG techniques to retrieve relevant emails from a personal email dataset. It parses through the dataset to identify the most pertinent emails in response to the user's question.

Contextual Responses: By generating responses based on retrieved emails, the chatbot provides coherent and context-aware answers, making the interaction more personalized and accurate.

Fluent and Accurate Answers: The system is designed to provide human-like, accurate responses by combining retrieval mechanisms and LLM's language generation capabilities.

Technology Stack
Pretrained Large Language Model (LLM): A state-of-the-art LLM is used to process and generate text for queries.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): A hybrid approach combining retrieval of relevant data and generative language modeling to deliver precise, informative responses.

Python: The core logic of the chatbot, including integration of the LLM and RAG model, is built using Python.

Email Dataset: A personal email dataset serves as the knowledge base for the chatbot, from which it retrieves email content for query responses.

How It Works
User Query: The user submits a natural language query related to their emails.

Email Retrieval: The system uses RAG to search the email dataset and retrieve the most relevant emails based on the query.

LLM Response Generation: The LLM processes the retrieved emails and user input to generate a fluent and contextually appropriate response.

Answer Delivery: The chatbot provides the user with an accurate response, which may include information from the retrieved emails.
