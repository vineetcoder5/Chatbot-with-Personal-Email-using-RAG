# Chatbot with Personal Email using RAG

This project demonstrates the implementation of a chatbot that uses **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to efficiently answer email-related queries. By leveraging a **Pretrained Large Language Model (LLM)** for natural language processing, the chatbot can retrieve relevant emails from a dataset and generate accurate, fluent responses based on user input.

## Features

- **Natural Language Understanding**: The chatbot is capable of handling complex queries, thanks to the integration of a powerful LLM. This allows for a seamless interaction experience, making the bot effective in understanding and processing user intent.
  
- **Email Retrieval**: The chatbot uses RAG techniques to retrieve relevant emails from a personal email dataset. It parses through the dataset to identify the most pertinent emails in response to the user's question.

- **Contextual Responses**: By generating responses based on retrieved emails, the chatbot provides coherent and context-aware answers, making the interaction more personalized and accurate.

- **Fluent and Accurate Answers**: The system is designed to provide human-like, accurate responses by combining retrieval mechanisms and LLM's language generation capabilities.

## Technology Stack

- **Pretrained Large Language Model (LLM)**: A state-of-the-art LLM is used to process and generate text for queries.
  
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: A hybrid approach combining retrieval of relevant data and generative language modeling to deliver precise, informative responses.
  
- **Python**: The core logic of the chatbot, including integration of the LLM and RAG model, is built using Python.

- **Email Dataset**: A personal email dataset serves as the knowledge base for the chatbot, from which it retrieves email content for query responses.
